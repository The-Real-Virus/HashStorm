# üíÄHashStormüíÄ

## üìúDescription
This is a hash cracking tool designed for testing and educational purposes only. It supports multiple cracking methods, including brute force attacks and dictionary attacks, using SHA-256 and MD5 hashing algorithms. The script is optimized for performance using multiprocessing to leverage multiple CPU cores.  

- Cython is a superset of Python designed to give C-like performance with code that is written mostly in Python. Used primarily to optimize Python code by compiling it to C, which can significantly increase execution speed, especially in CPU-bound tasks.  
- Cython code can include both Python and C syntax, allowing for more granular control over performance.    

## üîëFeatures
- ‚úî Supports SHA-256 and MD5 hashing algorithms  
- ‚úî Brute force attack with customizable character sets  
- ‚úî Dictionary attack using pre-defined or custom wordlists  
- ‚úî Multiprocessing for faster hash cracking  
- ‚úî User-friendly prompts for easy interaction  

## üöÄStep-by-Step Guide in Linux Terminal !

Step 1: Update & upgrade your system  
>sudo apt update  

>sudo apt upgrade  

Step 2: install Dependencies  
>sudo apt install cython3  

>sudo apt install python3-setuptools  

Step 3: Clone the repository  
>git clone https://github.com/The-Real-Virus/HashStorm.git  

Step 4: Go to the Tool Directory where u clone it  
>cd HashStorm  

Step 5: compile into cython py  
>python run.py build_ext --inplace  

Step 6: After Completing the process now u can run script  
>python -c "import cracker; cracker()"

## üí°Tips !
üåê Brute force attacks take longer, so prioritize dictionary-based cracking when possible.  
‚ö° Use a strong wordlist for faster and more effective dictionary attacks.   
üîÑ Ensure Python dependencies are installed before running the script.  
- üõ†Ô∏è Wordlists:
	Linux already have alot of wordlists also rockyou present at `/usr/share/wordlists`  
	or u can download here [rockyou.txt](https://github.com/brannondorsey/naive-hashcat/releases/download/data/rockyou.txt)  

## ü§ùFollow the Prompts !
1) Run the script:  
2) Choose the hashing algorithm and attack method.  
3) Enter the target hash to crack.  
4) Provide a wordlist file (for dictionary attack) or specify brute force parameters.  
5) View the cracked password if successfully found!  

## ‚öôÔ∏èTroubleshooting

1) `Issue: Slow Cracking Speed?:`  
- Increase CPU cores or use a better wordlist.  

2) `Issue: Missing Modules?:`  
- read the requirements.txt file, (cat requirements.txt) or (gedit requirements.txt).  

3) `Issue: Permission Denied?:`  
- try using sudo  

4) `Issue: Python3 or pip not found?:`  
- read the requirements.txt file, (cat requirements.txt) or (gedit requirements.txt).  

5) `Issue: Hash Not Found?:`  
- The password might be too complex for the current wordlist/brute force settings.  

6) `cython module not found?:`  
- try this command `pip install Cython --break-system-packages` permisson denied then use sudo at start.  

## üõ†Ô∏èMODIFICATION 
- U CAN ADD MORE HASHES ALGOS.  
- U CAN CREATE AND USE OWN WORDLISTS.  
- IF U WANT TO MODIFY OR USE THE SCRIPT IN UR PROJECTs , CONSIDER GIVING CREDITS !
